## Description
This project is a Python-powered AI assistant that uses a combination of Text-to-Speech (TTS), Speech Recognition (SR), and OpenAI’s language model to bring you a smart, voice-activated assistant experience. It’s designed to make everyday tasks easier by allowing you to talk to your computer just like you would talk to a person.
## Key Features:
- **Speech Recognition (SR):** Uses Google Speech Recognition to convert your spoken words into text, allowing for easy voice commands.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** After processing your request, the assistant responds with natural, human-like speech using TTS libraries like _pyttsx3_.
- **OpenAI Integration:** Powered by OpenAI’s _GPT-4o-mini_, the assistant provides intelligent, context-aware responses to questions and tasks.
- **Voice-Activated:** Control your tasks without lifting a finger! The assistant listens, processes, and speaks back to you, making it perfect for multitasking.
